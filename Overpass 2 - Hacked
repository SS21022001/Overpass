Overpass has been hacked! The SOC team (Paradox, congratulations on the promotion) noticed suspicious activity on a late night shift while looking at shibes, and managed to capture packets as the attack happened.

Can you work out how the attacker got in, and hack your way back into Overpass' production server?

Note: Although this room is a walkthrough, it expects familiarity with tools and Linux. I recommend learning basic Wireshark and completing Linux Fundamentals as a bare minimum.
